#This question was asked in an interview of ClassPass.
"' Question: We are given a Number N and a string with space separated as shown below. The Number represents
the number of rows in a seat arrangement in a plane and strings represents the seats already occupied or booked. 
We have to asked to book a seat for a family of three members and they all want their seats nearby. We have seat arrangement
as follows:
1------>  A-B-C   D-E-F-G   H-J-K
2------>  A-B-C   D-E-F-G   H-J-K

Numbers 1 and two represents the rows number and Alphabets are columns.
Please note that C-D or G-H are not consecutive.

See example
Function-> Solution(N,S)  --> N->Numbers (Rows),S->String (seat already filled) ----> should return available seats 
for family of 3 members.

Example:  Solution(2, "1A 1D 2B") --> Should return 4

1------>  A-B-C   D-E-F-G   H-J-K (1A and 1D occupied so we have EFG and HJK avilable for three)
          
2------>  A-B-C   D-E-F-G   H-J-K (2B occupied so we have three of four DEFG and HJK is avilable )
so total 4 of them is available

for empty string with the 1 row should return 3.
